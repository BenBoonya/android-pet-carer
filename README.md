# Tell us what your idea is.

We develop a mobile application called **Pet Carer**. It is a pet health observation and diagnosis service
for pet owners. Being healthy is essential for every living thing, including animals who cannot tell us that they are sick. Recently, our first beloved pet passed away because we lack the knowledge to perform
observation and evaluation on her health efficiently. We do not want this tragedy to happen again to any pet lover or us.

Performing health-checkup on pets regularly can help to prevent unpredictable tragedies from
happening. Traditionally we would take our pet to vets for diagnosis. However, Pet Carer can help you
perform initial diagnosis by yourself as well as help the vets to understand your pet better.

The **on-device machine** makes pet health-checkup by mobile applications possible. Pet Carer
application performs five necessary checks, including an observation on the respiratory organs, eyes, ears,
paws, and drops separately. The app uses photos and videos related to each inspection combining with
pet's physical information, such as weight records as inputs to our machine learning models to determine
the healthiness result of each check. The diagnosis will work seamlessly with no latency, even without an internet connection, and the user can choose to keep the diagnosis information secret.

We plan to make the application for supporting guinea pigs first then expand the service to other
popular pet categories. The beta version of the app can be found on the Google play store with basic
functions, like taking notes and recording weight.

We are waiting for approval on the Google play store.



# Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life.

##### (1) any potential sample code you’ve already written,

We have launched the beta version of the app with basic functionalities to play store.
Currently, we are developing the health-checkup feature which utilizes on-device machine learning
power. We use Firebase services such as Cloud Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase
Storage, and other Firebase services to manage and store all of the application data. The progress
of this feature can be seen in the sample code in this link

(<https://github.com/BenBoonya/android-pet-carer>).

We will use the Android Firebase ML
Kit along with pre-trained Tensorflow Lite models to classify and analyze the pet images. The
models are hosted on the Firebase project and will be updated automatically.

##### (2) a list of the ways you could use Google’s help,

1. Collecting categorized pet images for training the models. By using Google help will be
able to ask for cooperation from the pet research center or universities much more comfortable.
This link is the sample of guinea pig-related research papers that is very beneficial for the model training
process.

2. Mentorship to efficiently train the model to recognize problems or symptoms from the
image of specific area of pets.
3. Reach more audiences to gain more feedback from the real user for improving the
application.


##### (3) as well as the timeline on how you plan on bringing it to life by May 1, 2020.

We plan to develop the Pet Carer application from December 2019 to May 2020 with five
main processes.

##### December 2019
We will continue developing and testing the basic features like authentication, weight
record, and others then launch the public beta version of the application to the play store.

##### January to Mid-March 2020
We will find the data set and train model for the health check-up feature, which includes the
respiratory system, excretory system, eyes, paws, and ears.

##### Mid-March to Mid-April 2020
The trained models will be available for usage, we will bring these models to integrate with
the health check-up features and develops continually to get the completed application.

##### Mid-April to End of May 2020
We will gain the users, analyze the application performance, and improve the application
from the users' feedback.

##### After May 2020
We must maintain the application and plan to develop the new features for serving the
existing users and gaining new coming users.

The detail of the project timeline is in this below link.
